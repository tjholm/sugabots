/**
 * The tools a turn's model may call. One directory per tool under `tools/`;
 * this is the only place that knows which ones exist, so adding a tool is a
 * folder and a line here rather than a change to the turn's steps.
 *
 * Four kinds. The crew tool `collaborate` reaches other agents
 * and leave their own records. The built-in tools do work for the agent, the
 * sandbox tools work in the pod's sandbox, and the connection tools do work
 * at a server the workspace configured; every call to any of them is recorded
 * as a `tool_call` part of the reply (`calls/`). A connection tool turned off
 * is offered all the same, and each call to it is recorded as refused without
 * reaching the server.
 * `search_history` is recorded the same way, and offered only once the
 * thread has been compacted; `save_instructions` too, offered only while the
 * agent interviews its creator.
