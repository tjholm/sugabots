/*
 * A message is drawn as its parts, in order: text is a bubble and each
 * collaboration is the child thread it opened, at full width. So an agent that
 * writes, asks another agent, and writes again shows as a bubble, a child
 * thread, and a bubble, in the order it happened.
 *
 * A reply's text is drawn once it is settled, never as it streams. What the
 * agent writes on the way is often the lead-in to a tool call ("Let me find
 * the cycle:"), and that cannot be told until the call arrives, so text drawn
 * live would show words and then take them back. Text is settled when the
 * reply finishes or when something follows it: text before a collaboration is
 * shown while the collaboration runs, so the thread reads in the order it
 * happened. While the turn runs, one line says the agent is typing, or which
 * step it is on.
 *
 * Tool calls are not drawn as parts at all. They belong to the turn rather than
 * to the transcript, so once the reply lands they leave nothing behind — the
 * step count on the message's own action bar is the way to what they did. What
 * the agent said just before a call is narration and goes with them: the thread
 * shows the answer, and the activity log how it got there. The exception is a
 * write waiting to be approved, and one that was refused: those stopped or
 * changed the reply, so they stay in the thread, mid-turn included.
