/**
 * Everything the routes may ask core for. Each is a use case or a view whose
 * every method requires the current actor and authorizes them, or the event
 * streams' `ChannelAccess`, which does the same for a channel. The exception
 * is `Routines.Webhooks`, which nobody signs in to call: the routine's secret
 * admits the run instead. `Accounts` is here for the referral link; its
 * `admit` is better-auth's, for somebody who has no account yet.
 *
 * `apiLayer` requires these and nothing else from core, so a route yielding a
 * repository, a workflow's steps or a service that acts for nobody, such as
 * `TurnExecution` or `PersonalPods`, does not compile.
